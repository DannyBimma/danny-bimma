          Week 3: Putting a Pause on Actually Building the Web App and Starting
          Over; Because I Can‚Äôt Half-Ass Anything and I‚Äôm !Sorry üòê
        </h2>

        <p class="article-creds">Author: DannyBimma</p>

        <p>
          There‚Äôs an ostensibly meaningless line during the 2nd act of the
          Egghead Arc in the One Piece manga. It occurs when Vegapunk Stella
          initially went missing in the Labophase, prompting all available
          members of the Straw Hat crew to employ a binary search for the mad
          scientist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luffy, in his naturally asinine earnestness, immediately enters Gear
          5th and goes all out, assumes his strongest form as the God of the
          Sun, all for the insurmountable task of finding one relatively
          intelligent old man. I am Luffy; to build a simple web app, I need to
          regain total confidence in true computer science, not just
          programming‚Äîto reach my ultimate Code God form üò≠‚úäüèæ
        </p>

        <h2>Returning to the Basics</h2>

        <p class="article-content">
          I promise my preface to this is not based on some snobby, high-art
          view of computer science. Although I do love it enough to excuse mild
          snobbage and do believe that too much abstraction ruins the art that
          it is. There, I said it. I kinda hate abstraction, and Decorators in
          Python make my skin crawl ü§Æ
        </p>

        <p>
          So there‚Äôs no way for me to feel comfortable working with React,
          Angular, Django, Flask, or any other popular web building framework
          without having a fundamental understanding of how they actually work.
          And if I do end up being the very thing I sought to destroy by
          building yet another JavaScript framework for one very specific use
          case, then so be it.
        </p>

        <p>
          And so, I decided it would be a good idea to download Rust onto my
          machine, open up VS Code, and quickly build a simple CLI calculator
          app that adds two numbers together‚Äîand does literally nothing else. An
          app idea so simple I figured it would take me an hour at most,
          including understanding all the Rust-ass-tic syntax I needed to learn
          in order to build it in the first place. But figuring that was a
          mistake.
        </p>

        <h2>Relearning with C</h2>

        <p>
          I built a basic ‚Äúhello, world!‚Äù CLI program in C, with some minor
          added functionality for shits and a little giggle. The code I wrote to
          get this silly little program to do what I wanted it to do is
          objectively ugly, even by the loosest of standards. But I had a tonne
          of fun writing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          As it turns out, I never really got over the ass-kicking trying to
          build a calculator app in Rust gave me last week. Thus, I decided the
          only logical next step for me to take was relearning all the basic
          principles of computer science and programming from the very
          beginning. Ultimately building a web application that tracks what days
          anime/manga will drop and reminds users of the scheduling should have
          been a relatively straightforward affair. But this is what happens
          when you ask Luffy to do anything üòè
        </p>

        <p>
          Datatypes, variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and control flow
          are the basic building blocks of practically every computer program in
          existence. Solving the problem of printing ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù to the
          console in C presents a unique set of issues that you‚Äôd never
          encounter if you were to build that same program in Python or
          JavaScript.
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        Remembering that variables aren‚Äôt just some magic box that can store
        stuff‚Äîbut are instead pointers that point to an address in memory; that
        I can‚Äôt just snatch input out of a user‚Äôs ass without allocating the
        <code>[fgets]</code> memory for it, that ‚Äústring‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a
        primitive datatype computers recognise‚Äîbut that they are in fact a
        string of chars as the name so aptly suggests. All felt incredibly
        amazing to re-solidify as I free-styled the writing of this program.
      </p>

      <p>
        It felt like and really reminded me of another segment of the Egghead
        Arc in One Piece, namely, the Battleship Punching Bags flashback
        chapter. That section of story shows how Garp, teaching new recruits as
        an Admiral in the Navy, had a special training program to be undertaken
        by his most promising students. The regimen involved them punching the
        heavily armoured and reinforced hull of a marine battleship without the
        use of Haki or Devil Fruit abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Repeatedly throwing every ounce of their natural strength into punch
        after punch, until they eventually made a dent in the ship. And after
        years of consistent daily commitment to this routine, the dents
        eventually became cavernous. Causing an entire Navy ship of war to fold
        in on itself like a sheet of fail-paper thrown into a tumble dryer.
        Ultimately, the point of Garp‚Äôs extremely bloody and brutal training
        prohibiting the use of special powers, was to make his students that
        much more formidable once they did employ their souped-up abilities in
        battle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The training Garp put Aokiji and Koby through may have been utterly
        unnecessary to the end of training young recruits to be good Marines.
        However, his goal was never to make his students good enough. His goal
        was always to make them the absolute best the Navy had to offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building basic computer programs like ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù using low-level
        languages like C is totally unnecessary to the end of learning to
        program in today‚Äôs AI-powered world. It‚Äôs precisely akin to possessing
        the Hie Hie no Mi, or an unusual amount of Haki, and choosing to punch
        the reinforced hull of a fucking battleship in an obsessive and bruising
        effort to master the basics of throwing the perfect punch. And that‚Äôs
        precisely what I‚Äôm going to do!!
      </p>

      <p>
        What I have so far can be considered v1.1, as I do plan on expanding it
        to be the ultimate ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù program on the internet as time goes
        on. Over the coming weeks, I‚Äôll add to it and improve the code until
        this program reaches its final form. I created what will end up being a
        huge mono-repo of C code on GitHub for any fellow programmers who want
        to follow this nonsense; it‚Äôs going to be a gargantuan mess, and I think
        it‚Äôll be hilarious to see just how mountainous the mess I create will be
        in about a year of commits to this repo.
      </p>

      <h2 class="article-heading">Code Talk</h2>

      <p>
        One of the first improvements I want to make to my code immediately
        after writing this post is the functionality I wrote to check for a
        positive or negative response from the user:
      </p>

      <img
        class="content-img"
        src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5336e164-7216-4081-8cf2-8da9effcdc9f_3310x1534.heic"
        alt="my code block"
      />

      <p>
        Even though my code here has a face only a mother could appreciate, I am
        actually quite proud of it. Given C‚Äôs lack of string methods and it not
        even recognising strings as a primitive datatype out of the box. My
        solution of initialising a response value variable and then using
        control flow to set the value of that variable based on user response
        was so mentally stimulating it made my technical brain cum.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the only immediate improvements I want to make right now is moving
        that mess of a block of control flow code to a separate function, or
        maybe even an external file. And then maybe I‚Äôll ask ChatGPT for
        suggestions on making that formula more concise, because right now I
        can‚Äôt really stand to look at it and I‚Äôm quite literally its mother.
      </p>

      <h2>What of the Animanga App</h2>

      <p>
        Trailing off on a random side quest to learn and build a bunch of random
        things may seem like a very counterintuitive way to build software. And
        for all intents and purposes, it is!! But for me, it‚Äôll all be a part of
        the process. A dear friend of mine has a deep love for completing all
        the side missions in open-world games and opening every chest in a
        dungeon. Thinking of both her and Frieren made me realise that when
        we‚Äôre trying to go somewhere, getting distracted by the things we love
        along the way is more than okay. Matter of fact, it‚Äôs the only time we
        can experience the wonderful clich√© of enjoying the journey just as much
        or even more so than the destination.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I‚Äôll never forget what my ultimate goal is here; I just no longer
        care if it takes 6 months or 6 years. I don‚Äôt mind being the Oda
        Eiichiro of writing code, on the contrary. It would be an honour to
        spend the next 27 years building a simple web application for all the
        Nakama I met on Threads üò≠üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
      </p>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm mostly kidding, but in all seriousness, my autistic brain seriously
        underestimated the time it would take and the skills I‚Äôd need to relearn
        in order to build such a thing. And to be fair, I could use my latent
        knowledge, hack together something using a bunch of already established
        libraries and frameworks, and then maybe ask ChatGPT‚Äôs or Claude‚Äôs pro
        models to fill the gaps. Doing that, I promise I could have some
        semblance of a working anime and manga tracking application deployed to
        the web in less than a month. But by the end of it, I would have learned
        nothing and I‚Äôd be ashamed of all the dirty things I‚Äôd done to get
        there.
      </p>

      <p>
        However long the journey of me ultimately building this thing the right
        way takes, I‚Äôm now more excited than ever before to simply enjoy
        learning computer science and then immediately attempting to build fun
        pieces of software with the things I learn. Love is the most important
        aspect to consider when it comes to doing difficult things‚Äîonly when
        it‚Äôs involved can frustrations be transmuted into pure elation üíô!!
