          Attempting to Build with Rust as a Rusty Programmer
        </h2>

        <p class="article-creds">Author: DannyBimma</p>
        <p class="article-creds">Position: Editor in Chief</p>

        <p>
          I want to start off by going on a little random tech tangent this
          week:
        </p>

        <p class="article-content">
          The Rust programming language and its user base are the FMAB fans of
          the software development world. As in, their favourite thing is
          simultaneously as good as they say it is and also incredibly
          overhyped.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unsurprisingly, as soon as I got back into programming, it didn’t take
          very long for my ADHD brain to start getting distracted by every shiny
          technology that caught my eye—and I’d been eying Rust for years. Its
          evangelical fanbase never stops singing its praises to the heavens.
          Saying crazy and outlandish things like, “it gives you all the power
          and speed of C, coupled with the succinct joys of writing Python.” And
          as one of those developers who thinks C is the greatest programming
          language on the planet, I simply had to see what Rust was all about.
          Figured I’d maybe even write some server-side code with it for the web
          application. How hard could it be 🤷🏽‍♂️ ?
        </p>

        <p>
          And so, I decided it would be a good idea to download Rust onto my
          machine, open up VS Code, and quickly build a simple CLI calculator
          app that adds two numbers together—and does literally nothing else. An
          app idea so simple I figured it would take me an hour at most,
          including understanding all the Rust-ass-tic syntax I needed to learn
          in order to build it in the first place. But figuring that was a
          mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
          It ended up taking me 3 days, 4 headaches, 23 litres of tears, and 345
          swear words to build a calculator that only adds a single pair of
          numbers—a program which can only be run from the command line of my
          personal machine. It was literally the worst programming experience
          I’ve ever had in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          And yes, I know my failings with this language are a major skill
          issue. But I never want to write Rust again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, I have now concluded it should exclusively be used by
          real computer scientists and/ or black hat hackers, to either save or
          end many lives via novel memory management. That’s it. There’s no
          in-between for Rust programming. If you use it, you are either a saint
          or a serial killer 🙄
        </p>
      </article>

      <p>
        But in all seriousness, when people say Rust is a systems programming
        language, you best fucking believe that’s what it is. As a developer
        coming back to tech after a 2.5-year hiatus, ain’t no way I’m ready for
        all that. Computer science and programming are two different but closely
        connected things. Rust is for people who are building things that
        manipulate memory like JavaScript developers play around with arrays. Or
        who are working on projects that have to process millions of files per
        minute. Nonetheless, I know that now and I digress 🙂‍↕️
      </p>

      <h2 class="article-heading">
        Getting Out of the Imposter Syndrome Slump
      </h2>

      <p>
        Just do the things you know you know how to do. For me, that meant
        building a basic developer blog. Everything I did to build it is the
        selfsame process—on a significantly smaller scale—that I’ll go through
        to build the animanga project.
      </p>

      <h2 class="article-heading">Here’s what that process looks like:</h2>

      <p>
        Setting up version control is the very first thing you should do when
        coding up a big new project. Or any project you plan to ever make
        changes to, to be Franky. To get started, you can just create an empty
        repository on GitHub, clone it to a directory on your personal/work
        machine, create the initial files you need to build your thingamajig in
        the repository, and [git push origin main] those changes to the remote
        repo on GitHub.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next up, you’re going to want to start writing some sweet, sweet
        code—using the languages and technologies which are best suited for what
        you want to build and how you want to build it. For ya boy, this meant
        some HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. As I wanted to build a
        functional, responsive, and dynamic website using modern CI/CO best
        practices from scratch—in less than 24 hours like the Jack Bauer of
        writing code 😤!!
      </p>

      <p>
        I could have gone with Python, which would have been a little bit funner
        to write with Django or Flask or something. でも, JavaScript was the
        language I wrote my literal first lines of code in. And no, HTML and CSS
        are not programming languages—and one of the many hills I have no
        problem dying on in this world 🙄
      </p>

      <h2 class="article-heading">My Code and What I Built Widdit</h2>

      <p>
        After spending about 2 hours reading up on the 3 most popular web
        building technologies on Mozilla Web Docs, I was particularly surprised
        at how quickly basic web development started to come back to me.
        Especially JavaScript; guess it’s true what they say about people never
        forgetting their first language. Studying documentation and another 2
        hours or so of writing functions that do random things I imagined on the
        fly brought back my habituation with JS for the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I had a think about what I would possibly want my personal
        blog/portfolio to look like. I never built one before because I could
        never find the answer to that question. With this, however, I was able
        to think of all the real friends I made on Threads and how they’d
        encourage me to let my brain rot prevail. Thus, I came to the conclusion
        that I should build an absolute pointless and arbitrary Power Level
        Calculator. And maybe a landing page that’ll display the latest article
        from my Substack 🤷🏽‍♂️
      </p>

      <p>
        About 4 hours and 32 ounces of coffee later, the deed was done and I
        felt like a tech lord. I actually couldn’t believe I’d done it, even
        though it was something I’d done many times before. Someone near and
        dear to my heart reminded me that as neurodivergent people, we should
        always give ourselves the grace we afford to others. Especially when
        trying to do objectively difficult things.
      </p>

      <p>
        And speaking of, the big project I’m trying to build will be an
        “animanga tracker.” A web-app that will tell users which days of the
        week new episodes and chapters for the anime and manga they are
        following will be published. All of the data on said series will be
        acquired from the
        <a href="www.myanimelist.com">www.myanimelist.com</a>, naturally 😅
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, it IS an objectively difficult thing, and so my progress with it
        shall be ridiculously slow at first. There’s a lot I have to relearn,
        and a little I have to learn for the first time. And I swear on the
        righteous name of my Lord and Saviour, Monkey D. Luffy, that I will do
        it. Or spend the rest of my life trying 😭✊🏾!!
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, though: check out my personal blog/portfolio, play with the
        app, and peep what ya power level is 😬!!
